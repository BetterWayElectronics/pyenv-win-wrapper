# BwE PyEnv-Win Wrapper

Version: 1.0.0

## Overview

The PyEnv-Win Wrapper (PyWrapper) is a Python *and* Perl script designed to simplify the management and execution of Python scripts within a [PyEnv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) environment on Windows systems. It serves as a convenient environment variable/default application for running Python files while ensuring they execute in the desired Python environment.

### Features

    Python Environment Management: Checks if PyEnv is installed and available on your system.

    Python Version Selection: Execute Python scripts with the specific Python version set by PyEnv.

    Save Time & Effort: Negates the need to open a terminal session and having to manually run Python scripts.

    Beautiful Design: Shows my beautiful banner if run without a script or on any error. Has a Python .ico (in the compiled version).

### Prerequisites

    PyEnv-Win: Ensure that PyEnv-Win is installed on your Windows system.
    Install one or more Python versions!

## Usage
    1. Use the script as is, compile it yourself or download my compiled executable
    2. Set this program as the default for opening .py files
    3. Double click on any .py script and it will run normally!
    4. Change version normally by running the pyenv global 0.0.0 command
